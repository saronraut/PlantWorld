## Welcome to Plant World! Here you can access a huge selection of plants that reside within the United States. Using our Plant Search Tool, you can filter through the data and search for the plants that will grow perfectly in your preferred outdoor space. If you’re looking to murder someone, make sure you filter by toxicity levels while you’re here - because you’ll never know if oleander might be the right plant for you if you don’t check it out. If you love plants as much as we do, check out our Trend page to see what’s trending on Google in the Plant World!
